I am a 2nd year PhD student in the Computer Science department at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/). I am interested in Formal Reasoning about large scale differentiable program. I am presently advised by [Prof. Gagandeep Singh](https://ggndpsngh.github.io/). 

I am currently looking into different problems related to Deep Neural Network (DNN) verification including - verification of relational properties, incremental verification and formal guarantees for DNN intepretation techniques.
