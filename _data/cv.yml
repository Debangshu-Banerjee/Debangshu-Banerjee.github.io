    - title: 'Relational Verification of Neural Networks'
      institution: <a href="https://ggndpsngh.github.io/">Prof. Gagandeep Singh</a>, Assistant Professor, Dept. of CSE, UIUC
      description:
        Working on developing scalable relational verification algorithms for relational properties such as monotonicity, fairness, etc. 
        defined over multiple executions of Deep Neural Networks. The goal of this project is to enable trustworthy deployment of
        Neural Networks in financial and scientific applications.

    - title: 'Incremental Verification of Neural Networks'
      institution: <a href="https://ggndpsngh.github.io/">Prof. Gagandeep Singh</a>, Assistant Professor, Dept. of CSE, UIUC
      description:
        Working on developing algorithms for incrementally verifying Deep Neural Networks. 
        The goal of this project is to improve the runtime of the verification algorithm on Neural Networks after 
        modification - weight pruning, quantization, fine-tuning, etc by using the trace of the verification 
        algorithm on the original Neural Networks.
